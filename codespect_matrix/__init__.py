"""codespect-matrix — 16-Agent Code Evolution Platform

Debate Review · Hybrid Engine · Code Evolution

The 16-agent QA team that doesn't just find bugs — it measures code health,
tracks technical debt, analyzes architecture, and generates improvement roadmaps.

Key Features:
- 16 specialized agents: Security, Healthcare, PHI, Architecture,
  Performance, DevOps, Testing, Linter, Data Science, Hardcode detection
- 5-phase review: Inspect → Cross-review → Debate → Converge → Fix
- Hybrid engine: Rule+LLM for security/healthcare; pure LLM for others
- Dual memory: Project-level + Global KB (cross-project learning)
- AI autonomous fix: Scan → fix plan → user confirm → execute
- Code evolution: Health scoring · Technical debt · Architecture analysis ·
  Test coverage · Improvement roadmap

Usage:
    # Default multi-agent review
    codespect-matrix

    # Code evolution analysis (health + debt + architecture)
    codespect-matrix --evolve

    # Full review with JSON output
    codespect-matrix --max-rounds 3 --json

    # AI autonomous fix
    codespect-matrix --fix-plan && codespect-matrix --fix-execute

    # Python API
    from codespect_matrix.agents import AgentOrchestrator
    orch = AgentOrchestrator(project_path="/my/project")
    orch.initialize()
    result = orch.run_full_cycle()
